Object

    Object is one of the most important data-type found in javascript. object is used to store a collection of data about a particular thing. It is different from a primitive data-type. In primitive data-type a single variable stores single value.

    Storing collection of data is possible in object, because here variable dont store value, but a reference or a pointer stores a value. When ever a user need to access the value, he/she should access the pointer or reference, but not a variable.

How data is stored inside the object?

    Inside the object, the data is stored either as a property or a method. 

    A property is a object structure where a data is stored in "key : Value" pairs. For example,

                let obj = {
                    key1 : value1,
                    key2 : value2
                }
    
    Where as in a method, the value is replaced by a function. For example,

                let obj = {
                    key : function () {

                    }
                    }

How to access a value in a object?

    Value in a object can be accessed by two methods
        1. Dot notation method
            objectname.keyname;
            
        2. Bracket notation
            objectname["keyname"];
    
    Since data accessibility is so easy ib object, it has wide scope in javascript.    }
